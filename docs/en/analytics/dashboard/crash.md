# Crash report
Crash report provides metric and information about the crash events in your app.

Note: This article describes the default report. You can customize the report by applying filters or comparisons or by changing the dimensions, metrics, or charts in QuickSight. [Learn more](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/quicksight/latest/user/working-with-visuals.html)


## View the report
1. Access the dashboard for your application. Refer to [Access dashboard](index.md/#view-dashboards)
2. In the dashboard, click on the sheet with name of **`Crash`**.

## Where the data comes from
Crash report are created based on the following QuickSight datasets:

- `clickstream_user_dim_view_v1` - `Events_View-<app id>-<project id>` that connects to the `clickstream_event_view_v1` view in analytics engines (i.e., Redshift)
- `Events_Parameter_View-<app id>-<project id>` that connects to the `clickstream_events_parameter_view_v1` view in analytics engines  
??? example "SQL Commands"
    === "Redshift"
        ```sql title="clickstream_event_view.sql"
        --8<-- "src/analytics/private/sqls/redshift/dashboard/clickstream_event_view_v2.sql:2"
        ```
    === "Athena"
        ```sql title="clickstream-event-query.sql"
        --8<-- "src/analytics/private/sqls/athena/clickstream-event-query.sql"
        ```

## Dimensions and Metrics

The report includes the following dimensions and metrics. You can add more dimensions or metrics by creating "calculated fields" in the QuickSight dataset. [Learn more](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/quicksight/latest/user/adding-a-calculated-field-analysis.html).
